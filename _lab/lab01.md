Goal
====

The goal of this exercise is to practice with Turtle Graphics in
Python by producing somewhere between two and four Python functions
that use Turtle Graphics to make particular shapes.

(You'll understand the reasons its "between three and six" in a
minute.)

What you'll be drawing
----------------------

You'll be drawing functions to produce your initials, and the year you expect to graduate from UCSB.    For example, if your name is Pat Brady and you expect to graduate in 2021, you'll write these five functions:

-   `drawP(width, height)`
-   `drawB(width, height)`
-   `draw2(width, height)`
-   `draw0(width, height)`
-   `draw1(width, height)`

You'll use the `draw2` function twice, since the `2` appears twice in `2021`

If your name is Chris Carillo, and you are graduating in 2020, you'll only
need three functions:

-   `drawC(width, height)`
-   `draw2(width, height)`
-   `draw0(width, height)`

As you can figure out by now, "Phill Conrad" graduating in 2017 would
need six functions.

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from making more functions
if you want to, just for practice.  (And I encourage you to do so!)

You'll also include function calls that use your functions to put your
initials and graduation year across the screen twice at two different sizes:
once at the top, and once at the bottom, like this:

Your first step is to plan our your letters.

To do that, we have a worksheet, [IC00](/hwk/ic00/) for you to complete.

Start on that first, then refresh this page for more instructions.
