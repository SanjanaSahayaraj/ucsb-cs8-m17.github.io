<b >Typo corrections and hints for {{site.qtr}} exam {{page.num}}</b>

On question 4, the question references both FileNotFound and IOException.  This is a typo.  Those should both have been IOException, or both FileNotFound exception.

Since this correction is coming so late, I'll accept EITHER ANSWER.
