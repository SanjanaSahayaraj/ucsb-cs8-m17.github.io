<p>The first two questions are essay/short answer type of question, with
an emphasis on "short answer".

For this and *all other similar questions on this
exam*, answer as if you were in a *job interview*.
Your answer will be graded on the basis of whether it would be likely
to help you or hurt you in that context.   

Answers gain or lose points based
on whether they are accurate, precise, concise, relevant, and
whether they address the specific question asked.
</p>

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:15em;">(8 pts) What is a "Design Pattern"?

(See the note above about keeping essay/short answer questions short and to the point.)

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1em;">(8 pts) What is one of the benefits of having 
good test coverage for your code?  (Be sure that your answer demonstrates that you 
understand what "test coverage" means)

(See the note on the first page 
about keeping essay/short answer questions short and to the point.)

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> For this question, you need the additional
[handout](handout) with code for these files: `Book.java`,
`Product.java`, `Shippable.java`, `Song.java`.   These are classes used by the
startup E-Commerce company "Amazoony.com" 

You may assume that all of the code for these files on the [handout](handout) compilesâ€”I've checked that this is true. Now consider the code for the `Amazoony` class.

Please do these things with this "broken" code for the `Amazoony` class:

<ol>
<li markdown="1">

(10 pts) Several lines need to be eliminated from this file in order to make it compile. Find the lines that are bogus, and draw a line through each of them in the code listing above.
Hint: By "several", I mean more than 2, and fewer than 10. Start by determining which, if any, of the constructors are bogus. Then, eliminate any lines that refer to the variables created on those lines. Finally, check all of the remaining method calls.

You will lose two points each time you striking a line that is not bogus, and you will lose two points for failing to strike any line that IS bogus. So, choose wisely.

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class Amazoony {
  public static void main (String [] args) {    
    Song lf = new Song("Queen Latifah","Ladies First");
    Book rts = new Book("Julia Alvarez","Return To Sender",949,0.15);
    Product cstf = new Song("Justin Timberlake","Can't Stop The Feeling",79);
    Product fl = new Product("Drake","Fake Love");
    Shippable inf = new Shippable("Dan Brown","Inferno",999,1.5);
    Shippable tbt = new Book("Gwen Ifill","The Breakthrough",652,1.5);
    
    System.out.println("a:" + lf.getTitle());
    System.out.println("b:" + rts.getArtist());
    System.out.println("c:" + cstf.getPrice());
    System.out.println("d:" + fl.getPrice());
    System.out.println("e:" + inf.getTitle());
    System.out.println("f:" + tbt.getPrice());
    System.out.println("g:" + lf.getWeight());
    System.out.println("h:" + rts.getTitle());
    System.out.println("i:" + cstf.getPrice());
    System.out.println("j:" + fl.getPrice());    
  } // main method
} // class Amazoony
{% endhighlight %}

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;">

(4 pts) After striking through the bogus lines, the remaining code should compile and run. So, indicate what the output will be (if any) below. Be precise. If there will no output, write "no output".

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before" style="margin-bottom:8em;">
Java has two keywords that differ in only a single letter: `throw` and
`throws`.  Using the checked exception `java.io.FileNotFound` as an example,
provide an short example of how each of these keywords might be used.

Provide both at least one line of java code that contains the keyword
`throw` or `throws`, as appropriate, referencing `IOException`, and
then a brief explanation of the context of that line of Java
code, and what either `throw` or `throws` means in that context. 

You *may* add additional lines of Java code either above and/or
below that line of code if they help to provide additional
context&mdash;but that is *optional*, not required.  What I'm looking for
is the *shortest* code example that clearly illustrates your explanation
of the proper use of the two keywords.

<ol>
<li markdown="1"  markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;">(3 pts) Code example for `throw`
</li>
<li markdown="1"  style="margin-bottom:10em;">(3 pts) Explanation of code example for `throw`
</li>
<li markdown="1"  style="margin-bottom:10em;">(3 pts) Code example for `throws`
</li>
<li markdown="1"  style="margin-bottom:10em;">(3 pts) Explanation of code example for `throws`
</li>
<li markdown="1"  style="margin-bottom:1em;">(3 pts) Three additional points will be awarded by
the grader based on whether the entire explanation above, taken as a whole,
clearly illustrates an overall understanding of checked exceptions in Java and
the difference between `throw` and `throws`.  

If your explanation above
already makes that clear, you don't need to add anything here.    If you feel
that an additional clarifying remark is needed, write at most one or two sentences.

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> For this question, you need the additional
[handout](handout) with code for the class `ButtonDemo.java`.

You may assume that all of the code in `ButtonDemo.java` compiles and runs
successfully and produces a swing GUI that looks like this when it first loads
(I've verified that this is true):

![ButtonDemo.java.gui.png](ButtonDemo.java.gui.50.png)

<ol>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:15em;"> (10 pts) On line 19
you see a call to `addActionListener` that references a
named inner class.     Suppose we remove line 19, and replace it with the code that you
write in the space below (which could be a single line, or multiple lines, as
needed.)      Write some code that will do the same thing that will accomplish the
same thing as the current line 19, but using a lambda expression instead of an
instance of a named inner class.

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:15em;"> (10 pts) Now, the same idea, but
this time, replace the code on line 21 with equivalent code that references
an instance of an anonymous inner class.   
</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:15em;">  (10 pts) (CONTINUED FROM PREVIOUS PROBLEM).   A third option for the event handler for a button is to use
the class that contains the button&mdash;in this case, the class `ButtonDemo` itself&mdash;as the event handler.    This is normally used when we have only
a single event handler, but it is nevertheless possibly to use this technique in 
combination with other approaches.


In the space below, assuming that we start with the original
unmodified code for `ButtonDemo.java` from the handout, explain the
changes that would be needed in order to replace the call on line 19
that sets up the named inner class `Listener1` as the the event
handler for the Button with one that uses the object `ButtonDemo` itself as
the event handler.    

Explain which lines of code you would eliminate,
and what you would replace them with.    Here is an example of the format
your answer should take (this is just the *format*; it is very far from a
correct answer!)

```
Replace line 5 with
   public class ButtonDemo extends PotatoChips {

Insert above line 31, this method:

   public void handleEvent(int status) {
     System.out.println("I got this");
   }
```

</li>


<li markdown="1"> (10 pts) Write the code for the following static method.

The method takes an plain old java array of int (i.e. an `int []` value) and returns
an `ArrayList<Integer>` value.





```
public static ArrayList<Integer> arrayToArrayList(int [] array) {


















}
```
</li>



<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1"> In lab06, we explored the explored some challenges of working with legacy code, 
plus the basic ideas of how a compiler/interpreter works.

The code we were working with started with an arithmetic expression
such as `2 + 30 * 10` and transformed it, through a series of steps,
into the integer 302.  The three steps are known as tokenization,
parsing, and evaluation.

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:16em;" markdown="1">

(5 pts) In tokenization, we start with our input as a string,
e.g. `2 + 30 * 10`, and transform it into something else, something that is
the input to the parsing phase.

Briefly describe this process, and the nature of the output of
tokenization (which is the input to parsing).  For full credit, refer to the specific
string string `2 + 30 * 10` as an example.

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:16em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) Similarly,
parsing takes the output of the tokenization phase, and transforms it
into something else; something that is the input to the evaluation
phase (also sometimes called the "interpretation phase").

Describe this process, and the form of the output of parsing, making specific reference
to what would happen to the string `2 + 30 * 10`, and what data structure is produced
by the parsing phase (as input to the evaluation phase).
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:16em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) Finally, evalution takes the output
of the parsing phase and transforms that into an answer (in the case of our program,
that answer is an integer, e.g. `302` for the input `2 + 30 * 10`.

Describe this process, making reference to the data structure that is passed off
from the parsing phase to the evaluation phase.
