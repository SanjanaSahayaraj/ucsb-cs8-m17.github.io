# Midterm Exam

Link to actual exam: 

* [Actual Exam](cs56_f16_e01/){:data-ajax="false"}.
* [Handout](cs56_f16_e01/handout/){:data-ajax="false"}.
* [Handout 2](cs56_f16_e01/handout2/){:data-ajax="false"}.


[Typos and clarifications](typos){:data-ajax="false"}

Several practice exams are available.  Each comes with a handout, though not necessarily an answer key.   Practice with a friend or in a study group and compare your answers, or fill out an exam on paper and bring it to office hours or lab.   Time restrictions make it infeasible to prepare answer keys for each practice exam, or to answer individual questions over Piazza or email.

# Full exams from M16

*    [The actual M16 E01 midterm](cs56_m16_e01){:data-ajax="false"}, 
     and [handout](cs56_m16_e01/handout){:data-ajax="false"}

     and [handout](cs56_m16_e01_practice/handout){:data-ajax="false"}
     
   * Note: the material about "tokens" and "parsing" on these practice exams will not be our first midterm&mdash;we haven't yet covered that material.
     
# Partial Exams

*    [A partial practice exam, e01c](cs56_f16_e01_practice_c/){:data-ajax="false"},
     and [handout](cs56_f16_e01_practice_c/handout/){:data-ajax="false"}, prepared for use in lecture.
     Note that the second question is currently a duplicate of the one in the exam below.

*    [A partial practice exam, from M16 e01b](cs56_m16_e01_practice_b/){:data-ajax="false"},
     and [handout](cs56_m16_e01_practice_b/handout/){:data-ajax="false"}

<b>WARNING:</b> Just because a topic doesn't appear on either of these practice exams doesn't mean that it won't be covered on the midterm.
    
<b>ADDITIONAL WARNING:</b> The actual exam may or may not be more difficult/challenging than the practice
exam given here.   Use this to practice, but if the practice exam seems "easy", don't 
take that as a sign that you are "finished" studying.   I always try to come up with at least
a few new "types of questions" for each exam.

## What is covered

* [H00](/hwk/h00){:data-ajax="false"} through [H06](/hwk/h06){:data-ajax="false"}
* Chapters 1 through 13 in HFJ.
* [lab00](/lab/lab00), [lab01](/lab/lab01), [lab02](/lab/lab02),  [lab03](/lab/lab03)
* Lecture notes from start of course up to the class before the exam.

## Links to past exams

Note that the exact coverage of each of these exams varies quite a bit, since the pace of topics, and placement of exams during the quarter can vary considerably.  You are encouraged to look at all of them as examples of the types of questions you might be asked, but
match them against the topics we have covered, vs. the ones we have not covered.
