The code we discussed today can be found in this repository:

<https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-F16/lectureNotes_10.05>

The information covered is mostly the same as what can be found in first parts of this this article (the ones pertaining
to `==` vs. `.equals()`).

<https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/java_double_equals_vs_dot_equals/>

Information on `hashCode()` was not covered in detail&mdash;that was deferred to the lecture on 10.10.
