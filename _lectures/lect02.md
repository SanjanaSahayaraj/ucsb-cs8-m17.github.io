`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`

* Functions

# Turtle Graphics

We'll use IDLE (for Python 3).   The command to start it up at command line is  `idle3` (on CSIL, and on MacOS).
(On Windows, look for IDLE in the Start Menu).

A few commands:

```
>>> import turtle
>>> fred = turtle.Turtle()
>>> fred.forward(100)
>>> fred.shape("turtle")
>>> 
```

Documentation for Turtle:
