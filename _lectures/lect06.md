In this lecture we went over the procedures for [lab03](/labs/lab03/), our first look at legacy code.

As we discussed, each student has a pair partner, and a legacy code repo assigned to them.  Those
assignments are in this spreadsheet: (/info/projects/)

We discussed how points are estimated, and made reference to [Agile Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)

We also discussed what User Stories are, and the typical form they take:

* "As a (role) I can (do something thing) so that (I can acheive some goal)."

We discussed what "issues" are, and "issue tracking systems" (e.g. Mantis, Jira, Trac, etc.) and the fact that we are using
github itself for our issues backlog.
