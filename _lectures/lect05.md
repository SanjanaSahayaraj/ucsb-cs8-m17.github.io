The code we discussed today can be found in this repository.  Students are encouraged to look through the source code,
and to try to run it for themselves, and experiment with it:

<https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-F16/lectureNotes_10.10>

We reviwed the material from 10.05 on `==` vs. `.equals()` and then also covered `hashCode()`.


Some of the information covered is reviewed here:
