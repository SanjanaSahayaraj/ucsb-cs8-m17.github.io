<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read {{page.desc}}.  Then complete these problems.

<ol>

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li markdown="1" style="margin-botton:0em"> (20 pts) Page 68 lists this Python function definition that corresponds to the mathematical function $$ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $$

{% highlight python linenos %}
def f(x):
   res = x**2 + 1
   return res
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we can also write this more simply without the `res` variable, saving a line of code.    
{% highlight python linenos %}
def f(x):
   return x**2 + 1
{% endhighlight %}

Which version is better? That's a matter of <em>programming style</em>.  Often, but not always, writing in fewer lines of code is preferred.  With experience, you'll gain a sense of when to do one vs. the other.   For this problem, it is up to you which option to use.

In the space below, please write a function definition for the mathematical function $$ g(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 4 $$ 

<div class="pagebreak">
</div>

</li>

<li>  The following is a <em>function definition</em>.  Note that `def` is an abbreviation for definition:

{% highlight python linenos %}
def f(x):
   return x**2 + 1
{% endhighlight %}

Contrast this with a function call such as `f(3)`, `f(2 + 2)`, or `f(0.5)`.   Those evaluate to `10`, `17`, and `1.25` respectively.

Each of the problems below shows a function definition at left, then several function calls at right.  For each function call, write what the function call evaluates to.
