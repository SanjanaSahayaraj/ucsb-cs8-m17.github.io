<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

TODO: FILL THIS IN

<ol>

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li markdown="1"> 
(10 pts) As discussed in Section&nbsp;2.4, the `type()` function returns the type of a Python value.
When you pass a variable such as `x`, `type(x)` returns the type of the value that the variable `x` currently refers to.

Assume that the following assignment statement has been executed:

```
schools=["UCSB","Stanford","UCSD","Cal Poly"]
```

What will each of the expressions below evaluate to?  As a reminder, strictly speaking, Python will print types in the format `<class 'int'>`, `<class 'float'>`, `<class 'str'>`, etc. so *please use exactly that format* for full credit.
<style>
div.bigger table * td { padding: 0.7em 3pt 0.7em 3pt; }
span.wide { padding: 0pt 4em 0pt 4em; }
</style>

<div class="bigger" markdown="1">

| Points  | Expression  | <span class="wide">Result</span> | Points  | Expression  | <span class="wide">Result</span> |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| (4 pts) | `type(3)` |        | (4 pts) | `type(1+2.5)`     |        |
| (4 pts) | `type('3')`    |        | (4 pts) | `type(2 * "3")`|        |
| (4 pts) | `type("3.5")`    |        | (4 pts) | `type((3,3))` |        |
| (4 pts) | `type(3.5)`    |        | (4 pts) | `type(schools)`  |        |
| (4 pts) | `type([3,5])`    |        | (4 pts) | `type(schools[0])`    |        |

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Assume that `cases` is the name of a variable with a `float` value that you want to convert to an integer value.    Write a Python expression that converts `cases` to an integer (throwing away any fractional part)
</li>



<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Assume that `courseNum` is an integer that represents the numeric part of a course number (e.g. 3, 8, 130, 16, 24).    Write a Python expression that converts `courseNum` to an string (i.e. `<class 'str'>` in Python)
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) If you want to check whether x is greater than 10, and y is greater than 5, you can write the Python expression

```python
(x > 10) and (y > 5)
```

If `x` have the value `20`, and `y` have the value `17`, this evaluates to `True`.

But what if we accidentally wrote it as:

```python
(x > 10) + (y > 5)
```

What would this expression evaluate to, assuming the same values for `x` and `y`)?  (The answer requires you to read the section carefully, and then apply what you have learned.    I suggest you try that first before trying it at the Python command line.)
