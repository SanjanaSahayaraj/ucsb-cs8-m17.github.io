<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read {{page.desc}}.  Then complete these problems.

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) Section 3.1 discusses a feature of IDLE called "restarting the shell".   What does the book say happens when you restart the shell?
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Section 3.1 also discusses the `input()` function,
which is used to get input from the user.   It indicates that the result
of the `input()` function always comes back as a particular data type,
no matter what the user types in.   What is this data type?

<div class="pagebreak">
</div>

</li>

<li> (10 pts) On p. 56-57, the textbook suggests using the `eval()` function
to convert the result of `input()` from the user if it going to be used
as something other than a string (e.g. as a number, list, etc.)

THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HABIT TO GET INTO.  DON'T DO IT.

(We'll discuss this in more detail in lecture, but the short version
is: this is the kind of habit that leaves security vulnerabilities
open for hackers.    There isn't any real danger in an intro course,
because the software you write won't be run by anyone except you and your
TA, but in general, this is VERY bad habit to get into.)

So what can we do instead?  Well, you actually already saw one option&mdash;a technique that was discussed in Section 2.4.   Suppose we have this Python
statement:

```
ageAsString = input('Please enter your age in years')
```

Using techniques from Section 2.4, but NOT using `eval`, what line
of Python code can you write to convert
the value `ageAsString` into an `int` value?
